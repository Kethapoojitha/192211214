# AffordMed Social Media Metrics

This project is part of the AffordMed assessment. It includes a backend service and a frontend dashboard.

## Backend (Spring Boot)
- Built using Java and Spring Boot.
- Handles API endpoints to fetch and analyze social media data.
- Use Postman or Insomnia to test the backend APIs.

## Frontend (React + TypeScript)
- A dashboard that visualizes metrics.
- Consumes only the backend API endpoints.

## Setup Instructions

### Backend
1. Navigate to the `backend/` folder.
2. Run the Spring Boot application using your IDE or Maven.

### Frontend
1. Navigate to the `frontend/` folder.
2. Run `npm install` to install dependencies.
3. Run `npm start` to launch the frontend app.

## Notes
- Do not consume test server APIs directly from frontend.
- Backend handles all external communication.
